        <!-- It is possible to calibrate the detector distance using the tools available in the diffraction viewer. -->
		It's possible to display the rings from various calibrants using the tools in the MX image viewer. Before you being, go to the 
<b>Project Explorer</b> and double-click to open e.g. the image &apos;data/examples/ref-testscale_1_001.img&apos;.

         <b>Choosing the calibrant</b> There are a number of pre-entered calibrants in the preferences associated with the diffraction viewer. These are Cr2O3, Silicon and Bee&apos;s wax.

      <description>
         To manipulate the detector position return to the &apos;Image Metadata&apos; tab where the cross of buttons allows the beam centre to be moved around. It is also possible to enter the information into the relavant fields.
