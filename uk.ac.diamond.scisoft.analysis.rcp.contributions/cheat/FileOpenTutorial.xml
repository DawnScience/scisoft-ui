			There are several ways to access your data.

	</intro>
	<item title="Using File > Open File">
		<description>
			The simplest and unstructured way to access your data is to use the File > Open File...
			menu item. This opens the file selected in the "Open File" dialogue box in the editor
			area which lies right of the leftmost pane.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Project Explorer">
		<description>
			Other ways to access your data are contained in the two tabs in the leftmost pane:
			<b>Project Explorer</b> and <b>File Navigator</b>. The former allows you to create
			projects using File > New > Project... menu, selecting Data > Data Project and then
			filling the dialogue to create a project with a title and a folder that links to the
			given directory. Try doing this with, for example, <b>/dls/sci-scratch/ExampleData</b>.
			Note that no files are copied into that project. Also a right-button click in the
			explorer will allow access to the New menu item too.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="File Navigator">
		<description>
			The file navigator allows you to browse your computer's file system and navigate to the
			files of interest.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Access Your Data">
		<description>
			In both tabs, single (left-button) mouse clicks select a file. Any metadata held in the
			file contents and supported by SDA will be display in the metadata view pane situated in
			the bottom right-hand corner. Double clicking on a file will open that file in the
			editor area.
