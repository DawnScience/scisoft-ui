		<description>
			Once opened, the contents of your data file is presented in the editor area. The editors
			opened allow you to examine your data. The editor area can hold many opened files which
			can be switched between using the tabs at the top of the area. Each editor's presentation
			of a file's content will differ according to the type of data file format.
