			To visualise data effectively the DExplore perspective is the best perspective to use,
			change to this now.

	<item title="Create a new Project containing NeXus data">
		<description>
			Create a new data project if you don&apos;t already have one from the Diamond Example Data.
			<br/><br/>
			To do this use File -&gt; New -&gt; Project, and then select Data -&gt; Data Project and click
			on <b>Next</b>
			<br/><br/>
			Browse to the Directory which contains the NeXus files and click <b>OK</b>
			<br/><br/>
			The Data project should appear in the Project Explorer.
		</description>

	<item title="Open a Nexus Scan">
		<description>
			In the project explorer tab, navigate to the imported data project and double click on one of the NeXus files to open it for display.
<br/><br/>
The file should have opened in the Editor area (previously blank) and show a list of
			all the file metadata and an entry dataset.
<br/><br/>
			The file can be browsed through the NeXus Editor (Editor view) by clicking on the down arrow left of <b>entry1</b> (unfolding the NeXus sub elements). It can also be browsed through the Project Explorer by unfolding the NeXus file itself.

	<item title="Plotting the Data From the File">
		<description>
			To plot some simple data from the file, simply double click on the name of the data
			which you would like to see, that is, one of the
			sub-element of <b>entry1</b>.
			<br/><br/>
	Once this is selected you should see the data appear in the <b>Dataset Plot View</b>.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Multi dimensional data plotting">
		<description>
			The <b>Dataset Inspector</b> (Data axes selection part) reports how many dimensions the data has. DExplore allows data to be viewed in a variety of ways.
<br/><br/>
First let&apos;s consider 2D image data. To visualise this data type select the 2D image mode in the <b>Dataset Inspector</b>; this is done by selecting the
			<b>2D image tab</b> in the top right section of the view, you may need to expand the
			options if you cannot see it immediately by using the &apos;&gt;&gt;&apos; part to the right of existing
			tabs.
			<br/><br/>
			The NeXus image should now have appeared in the DataSet Plot. If the image is part of a 3D image stack it is possible to change which image is
			being viewed by using the dataset slicing section at the bottom of the <b>Dataset
			Inspector</b> view. There will be one slider bar which is not fully across. Drag this bar and you will see the image change in the <b>Dataset
			Plot</b> view.

	<item title="Surface Plotting">
		<description>
			Lets look at one other way of plotting the data. Instead of '2D image' tab, select
			'2D Surface'
			<br/><br/>
			The same tools are available, just you are now viewing a surface plot, and not an image.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Stack Plotting">
		<description>
			Finally lets look at one other way of plotting multidimensional data. Select &apos;1D Stack Plot&apos;. This displays all the data plots &apos;stacked&apos; together.
<br/><br/>
The dropdown boxes in the 1D stack tab allow the x-axis and z-axis of the stack plot to be specified.
<br/><br/>
Again, all the same tools are available for slicing the data.
<br/><br/>
Check the <b>in 3D</b> mode of the 1D Stack Plot to have a 3D view of your stacked plots.

		<description>
			This tutorial has taken you through some basics of looking at a NeXus data
			file. As a reminder, the slicing and visualisation tools used here would work on any
			multidimensional dataset (NeXus files being such possible datasets).
