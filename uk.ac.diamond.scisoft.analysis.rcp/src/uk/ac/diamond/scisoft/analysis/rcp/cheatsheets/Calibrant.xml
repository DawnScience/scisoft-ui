         <b>Choosing the calibrant</b> There are a number of pre-entered calibrants entered in the preferences associated with the diffraction viewer. These are Cr2O3, silicon and bee&apos;s wax.

      <description>
         The Calibrant can be seen by toggling the button marked &apos;Calibrant&apos; after checking the toggle ring box. It is also useful to show the beam centre as well.

      <description>
         To manipulate the detector position return to the &apos;Image Metadata&apos; tab where the cross of buttons allows the beam centre to be moved around. It is also possible to enter the information into the relavant fields.

To do this first make the beam centre visible and then, with the plot view selected, hold &apos;Shift&apos; and left click on the image where the beam centre should be. The beam centre will move to the position of the click.">
