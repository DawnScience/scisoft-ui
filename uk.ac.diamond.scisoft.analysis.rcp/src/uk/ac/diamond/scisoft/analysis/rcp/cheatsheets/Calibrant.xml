         <b>Choosing the calibrant</b> There are a number of pre-entered calibrants entered in the preferences associated with the diffraction viewer. These are Cr2O3, silicon and bee&apos;s wax. These can be found by opening the preferences window by &apos;Window&apos; -&gt; &apos;Preferences&apos; from the menu. Searching for &apos;Diffraction Viewer&apos; to bring up the correct window.

      <description>
         The Calibrant can be seen by toggling the button marked &apos;Calibrant&apos; after checking the toggle ring box. It is also useful to show the beam centre as well.

         title="Manipulating the detector position">
      <description>
         To manipulate the detector position return to the &apos;Image Metadata&apos; tab where the cross of buttons allows the beam centre to be moved around. It is also possible to enter the information into the relavant fields.<br/> There detector distance can also be manipulated along with the wavelength.
